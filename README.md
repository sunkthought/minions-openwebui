## Summary of the MinionS Open WebUI Function
### Overview
This code implements the MinionS protocol from HazyResearch's paper as an Open WebUI function. It marries the academic research of cost-efficient collaboration between local and cloud Language Models with Open WebUI's practical interface for users.
Key Components

### Protocol Implementation

Minion Protocol: A simple conversational approach where Claude (cloud) and a local Ollama model chat back-and-forth
MinionS Protocol: An advanced task decomposition approach where Claude breaks down complex queries into parallel subtasks

## How It Works

### Context Handling:

Extracts context from conversation history (messages longer than 200 chars)
Processes uploaded files through the __files__ parameter
Combines both sources to create a comprehensive context

### Minion Protocol Flow:

Claude receives the query but NOT the full context
Claude asks specific questions to the local model
Local model (with full context access) answers Claude's questions
Process continues for multiple rounds until Claude has enough info
Claude provides the final answer

### MinionS Protocol Flow:

Claude decomposes the task into simple, parallel subtasks
Local model processes each subtask on document chunks simultaneously
Results are filtered and aggregated
Claude synthesizes the final answer from the subtask results

### Cost Efficiency:

The MinionS protocol reduces cloud model costs by only "reading" the data locally, and communicating a compressed version of the context to the remote model
Averaged across tasks, MinionS with an 8B parameter local LM can recover 97.9% of the performance of remote-only systems at 18.0% of the cloud cost
The function calculates and displays token savings using real Anthropic pricing

### Open WebUI Integration Features:

Valves: Configurable parameters (API keys, model selection, timeouts, etc.)
File Handling: Processes uploaded documents through Open WebUI's file system
Conversation Display: Optional display of the full local-remote conversation
Debug Mode: Technical details for troubleshooting

### Key Optimizations:

Small LMs struggle to follow multi-step instructions. We find that splitting complex instructions into separate requests improves performance by 56%
Small LMs get confused by long contexts. Increasing context length from < 1K to > 65K decreases performance by 13% on a simple extraction task
The implementation addresses these by chunking documents and simplifying tasks

### Error Handling:

Timeout management for slow local models
Fallback from MinionS to Minion if too many timeouts occur
Graceful degradation when no context is available

### Conclusion:
This implementation demonstrates how cutting-edge research can be made accessible to everyday users through Open WebUI. It allows users to:

Use expensive cloud models (like Claude) more efficiently
Keep sensitive documents local while still leveraging powerful cloud AI
Get near-identical quality at a fraction of the cost

The function creates a "supervisor-worker" relationship where Claude acts as the intelligent supervisor who knows what questions to ask, while the local model acts as the worker with access to all the documents, extracting only what's needed.
