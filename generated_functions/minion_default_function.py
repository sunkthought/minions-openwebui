2.  Receive and understand the information provided by the local assistant.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- DO NOT ask the local assistant to provide the entire document or large raw excerpts.
- DO NOT express that you cannot see the document. Assume the local assistant provides accurate information from it.
- Your questions should be aimed at extracting pieces of information that you can then synthesize.

If, after receiving responses from the local assistant, you believe you have gathered enough information to comprehensively answer the user's original query ("{query}"), then respond ONLY with the exact phrase "FINAL ANSWER READY." followed by your detailed final answer.
If you need more specific information from the document, ask the local assistant ONE more clear, targeted question. Do not use the phrase "FINAL ANSWER READY." yet.
